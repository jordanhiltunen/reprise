# Reprise

[![build](https://github.com/jordanhiltunen/reprise/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jordanhiltunen/reprise/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Reprise is a performance-first Ruby gem that provides support for defining event recurrence
rules and generating & querying their future occurrences. Depending on your use case, 
you may see a speedup of up to 1000x relative to other recurrence rule gems. Reprise
is a thin Ruby wrapper around an extension written in Rust; this allows us to offer a level
of speed and conservative memory use that we would otherwise be unable to accomplish in
pure Ruby alone.

## Design Goals

- Raw performance & memory efficiency.

## Design Non-Goals

- Offering multiple methods / calling conventions for each feature.
  We are calling into Rust functions, relying on a very strict
  typed language to do the heavy lifting for us. Libraries like 
  ice_cube and montrose offer remarkable flexibility in a Ruby idiom; 
  if those libraries make sense for your use case, you should probably
  use them.
- Supporting serialization to and from iCal. We are straying from that
  standard in meaningful ways. For example, we do not define exclusions by
  date, but by specific time ranges. This allows the library to handle 
  exclusion collision detection without client applications having to 
  implement that core scheduling concern on their own, outside of schedule
  expansion.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "reprise"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install reprise

## Usage

### Initialize a new schedule

All schedules must be initialized with a start time, end time, and time zone.

```ruby
starts_at = Time.current.in_time_zone("Hawaii")
ends_at = Time.current + 4.weeks

schedule = Reprise::Schedule.new(starts_at:, ends_at:, time_zone: "Hawaii")

# 2. Define recurring series
schedule.repeat_weekly(:sunday, time_of_day: { hour: 9, minute: 30 }, duration_in_seconds: 60)
````

### Add recurring event series

```ruby
# When a time_of_day is required, you can pass an hour/minute/second hash:
schedule.repeat_weekly(:sunday, time_of_day: { hour: 9, minute: 30 }, duration_in_seconds: 60)

# Or, you can pass a `Time` value:
time = Time.new(2024, 6, 30, 0, 0, 0, "-10:00")
schedule.repeat_weekly(:sunday, time_of_day: time, duration_in_seconds: 60)

# You can repeat monthly by the nth day; e.g. the third Tuesday of every month:
schedule.repeat_monthly_by_nth_weekday(:tuesday, 2, { hour: 1, minute: 2, second: 3 }, 300)

# Or monthly by day; e.g. the 12th of every month:
schedule.repeat_monthly_by_day(12, { hour: 1, minute: 2, second: 3 }, 300)

# Or hourly: 
schedule.repeat_hourly(
        time_of_day: { hour: 1, minute: 2, second: 3 },
        duration_in_seconds: 300
)
```

## Development

### Compilation

- `rake compile:reprise`

After checking out the res
po, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Generating Documentation

Generate documentation within the `./docs` directory so that it can be
easily imported into GitHub pages. 
See: https://medium.com/make-school/a-cheatsheet-to-generate-documentation-for-your-rails-project-on-gh-pages-e28f6acfb9b9

```
bundle exec rake yard
```

- [ ] TODO: When we have a decent 0.0.1, publish the yarddocs
- on GitHub.

## Benchmarks

You can run benchmarks locally via `bundle exec rake benchmark`.
